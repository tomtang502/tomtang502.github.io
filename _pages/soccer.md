I started to play soccer in my middle school (Haidian, Beijing), in which we only have two class in our program and several other class in the general program so the only games we had was between these classes.

I used to play in both Junior Varsity and Varsity in my high school. In JV, I played right back or right wing, and in varsity I play bench keeper and water fountain keeper. Our varsity team was rank as the national 12th among all high school soccer varsity in the U.S., we were a 5-year TCIS Champion and a 4-year Virgiania State chanpion (I was only in the team for 2 years). Although I sit on bench for the most of time but when we get one-side dominance I will get to play position such as right back, right-wing, right forward, and left forward.

After I entered college, I still play pickup games every week when I have time (and some of my friends from DROP lab also play at the same time), and I am also trying to start playing in the intramural games.
