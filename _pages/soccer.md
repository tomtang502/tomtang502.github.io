I started to play soccer in my middle school (Haidian, Beijing), in which we only have two class in our program and several other class in the general program so the only games we had was between these classes.

I used to play in both Junior Varsity and Varsity in my high school, and our varsity team was rank as the national 12th among all high school soccer varsity in the U.S., we were a 5-year TCIS Champion and a 4-year Virgiania State chanpion (I was only in the team for 2 years). My primary position is bench keeper but when we get one-side dominance I will get to play position such as right back, right-wing, right forward, and left forward.
