Hi! I am a junior at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) major in `Computer Science` (System and Network Concentration) with an additional major in `Robotics`.

I like to work with robotics, and I've already worked with robotic arm, quadraped, and humanoid, and my mian focus in robotics is `robotic perception and control`. In addition to robotics, I am actively learning and practicing with `distributed system` and `computer networks` both inside class and outside of classes.

I used to be a big fan of subatomic particles and quantum physics, and I've both won awards in Physics Olympiad and done researches in physics before I started my undergraduate life (Checkout the bottom in [Publications](/publications/)).
